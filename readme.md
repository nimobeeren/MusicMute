#### Usage
By default, you can mute music in-game at any time by pressing F8. This key can be configured by editing the `Settings.cfg` file found in `GameData\MusicMute\Config`.
You can change the toggle key, as well as configure a modifier key that has to be pressed at the same time, like `LeftAlt`, `LeftControl` or whatever you want.

For the full list of keys you can use, see [Unity Script Reference](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html).

You can also choose wether you want to start the game with muted music or not. Set the value of `startMuted` to either `true` or `false` to use this feature.

You can easily install this addon by unzipping the contents of the supplied GameData folder into the `GameData` folder that is inside your KSP installation directory.
