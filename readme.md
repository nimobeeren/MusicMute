#### Function
MusicMute is an addon that lets you mute and unmute KSP's music, using a user-configurable hotkey.

#### Usage
By default, you can mute music in-game at any time by pressing F8. This key can be configured by editing the Settings.cfg file found in GameData\MusicMute\Config.
You can change the toggle key, as well as configure a modifier key that has to be pressed at the same time, like LeftAlt, LeftControl or whatever you want.

For the full list of keys you can use, see http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html

You can now also choose wether you want to start the game with muted music or not. Set the value of the startMuted key to either true or false to use this brand-new feature!

#### Installation
You can easily install this addon by unzipping the contents of the supplied GameData folder into the GameData folder that is inside your KSP installation directory.
This is usually "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Kerbal Space Program\GameData".
